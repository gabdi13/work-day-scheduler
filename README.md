# work-day-scheduler

I was tasked in this project to create a calneder application that allows user to log activities in a designated time block. The activities would be locally stored and allow the user to keep track of their scheduled actvities. I feel I have attacined this project and only missied from the objjectives of the project incorprating colour-coding the timeblock with relation to time. I will endeavour to add that functioality in the coming christmas break. 

I have been able to reinforce a lot of the learnings from the previous week and develop DOM skills & web api skills further.
